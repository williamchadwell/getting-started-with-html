<b>What makes the Web Work?</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with one other. When a person goes to a web
  page like www.yahoo.com, their computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
</p>

<b>What is HTML?</b>
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML is made up of <em>text content</em> which is "what you see"
  as well as <em>markup</em> which describes "what it actually looks like".
</p>

<b>Elements and Tags-</b>
<p>HTML documents are made up of HTML elements (<name> contents </name>) This whole thing
  is called an <b>element</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element 
  by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
</p>
<b>What elements are considered inline?</b>
<p>-a </p>
<p>-span </p>
<p>-br </p>
<p>-img </p>
<p>-strong</p>
</p>
<b>Do some people consider Computers are Stupid? <em>YES</em></b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer will cause huge problem within 
  a program.
</p>

<b>Differences between block and inline elements-</b>
<p>HTML elements are fall under two categories: <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form whats called an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
